## Description:

TreeStructure is a JavaScript project aimed at representing hierarchical data structures in a tree format. It provides utilities for creating, manipulating, and visualizing tree structures in web applications.

---

## Features:

- Tree Creation: Easily create tree structures programmatically.
- Manipulation: Add, remove, or modify nodes within the tree.
- Traversal: Traverse the tree using various algorithms such as depth-first search or breadth-first search.
- Visualization: Render the tree structure dynamically for user interaction.

---

## Usage:

1. Installation: Download or include the TreeStructure library in your project.
2. Initialization: Create a new instance of the tree and define its root node.
3. Manipulation: Use the provided methods to manipulate the tree structure as needed.
4. Visualization: Utilize the visualization features to display the tree structure in your web application.

---

## Example:

```javascript
// Create a new instance of the tree
const tree = new Tree();

// Define the root node
const rootNode = new TreeNode('Root');

// Add child nodes
rootNode.addChild(new TreeNode('Child 1'));
rootNode.addChild(new TreeNode('Child 2'));

// Set the root node
tree.setRoot(rootNode);

// Visualize the tree structure
tree.render('tree-container');
```
